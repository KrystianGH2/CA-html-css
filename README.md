# CA-html-css

From the design course assignment, main change thats was done with this project is the theme color of the body, I removed the gradient background color form the body to create a better visual of the page and making it simple but readable. I have used the same visual elements, such as fonts, font color, button color, and icon colors and styles on my pages. The main point of this change is about consistency and simpleness. 

I chose colors; ocean blue, white, , green, black and grey,
as these colors seems to compliment each other, and suitable for the logo. 

At the navigation bar, i decided to make horizontal and vertical navigation bar depending on screen size's keeping it consistent throughout the page.
i made the items clear to see by changing the scale bigger, colored text and an underline on the highlighted text. This also applies on important links like, "sign in and register" and icons.

I made every call to action (CTA) obvious, shifting it to color green when on hover and active.

To present text's best, i made the amount of paragraphs and sentences short, i used roboto / sans serif font family as this makes it easier to read/scan the website.
Images and the logo on the page has a scale on hover, as i wanted them to look functional. The logo brings you to the second home page, where the profile and cart icons are.


Responsiveness of the page on different screen size's. The pages response on different size's,  Items gets smaller/bigger, and sections shifts to different looks on different screen size's.

sign in / register
i made both forms very simple and readable, the inputs are functional, and added an option "create one" if you don't have an account, and "log in" option when already have an account. Both links directs you to sign in and register pages.

The contact page is responsive and has great sizing input fields and text area. This shifts from column to row and screen gets bigger.

The site is easy to navigate.
i came across some cons while making the site, it is was not easy to make some popup page with out javascript. I had some popup pages such as sign in/register and checkout page, i mimicked these pages by making a whole new html page, so every pages has an different css files. 

Overall making this website was great.
